# Task Tracker

A simple Task Tracker built with React, allowing users to create, manage, and track tasks. The project currently uses `JSON Server` as a mock back-end to simulate data storage. This app is a great way to manage your tasks efficiently, with reminders and easy toggling of tasks.

## Features

- Create new tasks
- Set task reminders
- Toggle reminders for specific tasks
- Delete tasks
- Responsive UI
- Mock back-end using `JSON Server`

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this Task Tracker app, I gained valuable insights:

1. **React Component Structure**: I learned the importance of structuring components in a reusable and modular way. This helped in keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

2. **State Management**: Managing state effectively is crucial in React applications, especially when dealing with forms, toggles, and user interactions. I improved my understanding of how to handle local component state and passed props efficiently between components.

3. **Mocking a Back-End Server**: Using `JSON Server` as a mock back-end was a great way to simulate real-world API interactions without the need for a full-stack back end during the early stages of development. It also helped me practice working with HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE).

4. **Importance of UX**: Building a task management app made me more conscious of user experience. Features like toggling reminders and adding visual feedback (colors, buttons) are simple yet essential for a smooth user journey.

5. **Planning for Future Enhancements**: While using a mock server was great for this project, I realized the importance of planning for future scalability. This led me to plan optimizations, such as integrating a Node.js server and MongoDB for more robust, persistent data handling.

6. **Version Control**: Working on this project has strengthened my version control skills, especially in keeping commits granular, creating meaningful commit messages, and maintaining a clean Git history.

This project has been an excellent learning experience, and I'm excited to continue improving both the app and my development skills.

## Optimization

In the future, I plan to replace the current `JSON Server` mock back-end with a fully functional back-end built using **Node.js** and **MongoDB** as the database. This will allow for more scalable and persistent data storage, as well as enhanced functionality such as:

- **User Authentication**: Implementing user sign-up and login features to allow multiple users to manage their own task lists.
- **Real-Time Data Persistence**: Using MongoDB for storing tasks will ensure that user data is saved permanently, even after refreshing the page or reopening the app.
- **API Security**: By building a custom Node.js server, I can add security measures like data validation, authentication, and authorization to ensure secure API interactions.
- **Task Synchronization**: Synchronizing tasks across devices by storing user-specific tasks in the MongoDB database, enabling users to access their tasks from any device.

I am excited to work on these optimizations when time allows and look forward to enhancing the app's functionality for a more robust user experience.
